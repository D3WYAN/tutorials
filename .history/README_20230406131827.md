In this guide you will learn how to publish tutorial pages on lablab.

### General information

- [Check out the technology page template](https://github.com/lablab-ai/technologies/blob/main/template.mdx)
- Please **don’t** copy the content from other websites!
- Please **don’t** use AI content generators to create the content for this page!

If you want to publish a new tutorial on lablab.ai, follow these steps:

1. Create a file for the tutorial with the tutorial title in slug format [here](https://slugify.online/) in this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lablab-ai/tutorials](https://github.com/lablab-ai/tutorials)


## Create a technology provider page

4. Create a page for the technology provider that includes the following information:
    - **Title**: Same as the provider's name.
    - **Description**: A brief (88-158 characters) description that includes one main keyword related to the provider (e.g., "OpenAI").
    - **Table**: Start with a heading (H1) that includes the company name, description, and the date it was founded. If the provider has a public repository, include a link to it.
    - **Start building with provider's products**: Create a heading (H2) that says "Start building with [Provider's] products" and write a short introduction (at least two sentences) about the company's products. End with a sentence that encourages readers to check out the apps created with this technology during lablab.ai hackathons.
    - **List the products**: Use the heading (H2) for the technology, and include a short description and a link to its page.

## Create a page for a specific technology

5. If you're adding only one technology, use the index file for the technology. If you're adding multiple products, create a separate page for each technology using its name as the title.
6. For each technology page, include the following information:
    - **Author**: Name of the provider (e.g., 'author="OpenAI"').
    - **Table**: Include the release date, author, link to documentation, link to the public GitHub repository, and the type of technology you're adding.
    - **Start building with the technology section**: Create a heading (H2) that says "Start building with [Technology]" and write a short description of the technology. End with a sentence that encourages readers to check out the community-built use cases and applications.
    - Below, please remember to include **`<TechTutorials/>`** component that will automatically link the tutorials on lablab relevant to the technology.
    - **Links, Libraries, Boilerplates, and Resources**: Include relevant resources to help others start building with the technology. Create separate sections for links, libraries, boilerplates, and other resources. Use H3 headings.

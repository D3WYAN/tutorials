## What is Whisper?

Whisper is an automatic State-of-the-Art speech recognition system from OpenAI that has been trained on 
680,000 hours 
of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. This large and diverse 
dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. In 
addition, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those 
languages into English. Unlike DALLE-2 and GPT-3, Whisper is a free and open-source model. OpenAI released
 the models and code to serve as a foundation for building useful
applications that leverage speech recognition.

## How to transcribe a YouTube video

In this tutorial we will use Whisper to transcribe a YouTube video. We will use the Python package "Pytube" to 
download convert the sounds into a `MP4` file. You can find the repo of Pytube [here](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)

First, we need to install the Pytube Library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
!pip install -â€” upgrade pytube
```

For this tutorial I'll be using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7X9w_GIm1s) "Python in 100 Seconds" Video. 

Next, we need to import Pytube, provide the link to the YouTube video, and convert the audio to `MP4`:

```python
#Importing Pytube library
import pytube

# Reading the YouTube link
video = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7X9w_GIm1s"
data = pytube.YouTube(video)

# Converting and downloading as 'MP4' file
audio = data.streams.get_audio_only()
audio.download()
```

The output is a file named like the video title in your current directory. In our case, the file is named `Python in 100 Seconds.mp4`
Now, the next step is to convert audio into text. We can do this in three lines of code using whisper. First, we install and import 
whisper. Then we load the model and finally we transcribe the audio file.

# Installing Whisper libary
```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git -q
```

```python
import whisper
```

Load the model. We'll use the "base" model for this tutorial. You can find more information about the 
models [here](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md). Each one of them has tradeoffs between 
accuracy and speed (compute needed).

```python
model = whisper.load_model("base")
text = model.transcribe("Python in 100 Seconds.mp4")
```

And now we can print out the output.

```python
#printing the transcribe
text['text']
```

You can find the full code as Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/lablab-ai/How-to-use-Whisper-to-transcribe-a-YouTube-video-Tutorial/blob/main/whisper-transcribe-youtube-video.ipynb)
